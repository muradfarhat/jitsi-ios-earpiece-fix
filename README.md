# 📱 Jitsi Meet iOS SDK – Earpiece Audio Fix (Custom Build)

## Overview
This repository contains a **custom-built version of the Jitsi Meet iOS SDK** where the default audio output has been modified to improve the call experience:

- 🗣 **Audio Calls** → Default output: **Earpiece**  
- 🎥 **Video Calls** → Default output: **Speaker**

This behavior differs from the official SDK, which routes all audio (including voice-only calls) through the speaker by default.

---

## ⚙️ What Was Changed
The modification was made in the following file of the Jitsi Meet iOS SDK source:


### Changes made
- Updated the audio session configuration to make the **earpiece** the default route for **audio calls**.  
- Kept the **speaker** as the default route for **video calls**.  

After editing, the SDK was rebuilt into an `.xcframework` following the **official Jitsi build instructions**.

---

## 🏗 Building the Framework
The SDK was built using the official method described in the Jitsi documentation:  
🔗 [Building the Jitsi Meet iOS SDK](https://jitsi.github.io/handbook/docs/dev-guide/dev-guide-ios-sdk#building-it-yourself)

### Steps followed
1. Cloned the official Jitsi Meet repository.  
2. Edited `AudioMode.m` to modify the default audio routing behavior.  
3. Built the `.xcframework` using the provided Gradle and Xcode scripts.  
4. Integrated the resulting `JitsiMeetSDK.xcframework` manually into the iOS project.

---

## 🧩 Dependencies
To use this custom SDK locally, you need to add:

- `JitsiMeetSDK.xcframework`  
- `Hermes.xcframework`

Both should be added **locally** to your iOS project (not through CocoaPods or Swift Package Manager).

---

## 📦 Integration (Manual)
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Drag and drop the following frameworks into your Xcode project:
   - `JitsiMeetSDK.xcframework`
   - `Hermes.xcframework`
3. Ensure **“Embed & Sign”** is selected in your target’s **Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content** section.  
4. Clean and rebuild your project.

## 🧠 Notes
